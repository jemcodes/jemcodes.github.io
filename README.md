## Meet The Dev

Hiya, I'm jane! üëã

Programming brings together my passions for building, creating, and problem-solving. Before coming to the coding world, I worked several lifetimes' worth of creative and analytical careers, from founding and managing companies to voiceover work to digging deep into disability law - and almost everything else in between. As a multipotentialite, I'm thrilled to see where this programming journey takes me!

You can find me right here on [Github](https://github.com/jemcodes), over on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jemcodes/), or [check out my resume](http://resume.jemcodes.com/)
