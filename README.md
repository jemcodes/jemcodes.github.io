## Meet The Dev

Hiya, I'm jane! ðŸ‘‹

Programming brings together my passions for building, creating, and problem-solving. Before coming to the coding world, I worked several lifetimes' worth of creative and analytical careers, from founding and managing companies to voiceover work to digging deep into disability law - and almost everything else in between. As a multipotentialite, I'm thrilled to see where this programming journey takes me!
